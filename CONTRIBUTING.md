# Contribution Guidelines
1. All work should be conducted in feature branches that originate off of the **dev** branch.  
2. All work should be submitted as pull requests intended to be merged into the **dev** branch.  
3. Please include a detailed explaination of what the pull request contains so that reviewers can understand what is included (from a business standpoint, not a technical one).
4. Outline all Azure configuration requirements for the pull request in the pull request comments. 
5. Comments made on pull requests should be addressed by committing new work to the branch the pull request was made on.
6. If you do something in git that you didn't want/expect then **stop**. Get help.

#### Code changes that don't follow the above will be summarily rolled back
